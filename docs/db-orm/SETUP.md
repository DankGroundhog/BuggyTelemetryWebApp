# PostgreSQL setup
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to run ```npm install``` for the installation of dependencies for Postgres and Sequelize. Also, make sure to copy *setup_db_env.js* file from the team [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/15LJI6dl-cDeiw7PLj_JIWC2deAn-djXg) and paste it in the project under */src/api/config/*.

Download PostgreSQL [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Make sure to download version **10.XX**.

## Setup database 
This instructions are based in pgAdmin3 (similar with pgAdmin4).

### Create a new server
Make sure to setup the following properties: 

```
name: whatever you like
host: localhost
port: 5432 (it doesn't matter anyway)
maintenance_db: postgres
username: postgres
```

Click OK to create the new server.

### Create a new login role
In Login Roles create a new role.

Properties:
```
role_name: buggy_user
```

Role privileges, select the options: 
* Can Login
* Can create databases
* Can create roles
* Can initiate streaming replication and backups 

Press OK and continue.

### Create database
In Databases, create a new database named "buggy_db" and set the owner to "buggy_user".

Your all set! Create and drop tables as usual. In the folder `..\src\api\models` run the commands: 
```
# Create tables
$ node dataModels.js create

# Drop all tables
$ node dataModels.js drop
```
